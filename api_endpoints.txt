# VIPRA HR Assistant API Documentation

This document provides a high-level overview of the VIPRA HR Assistant API, its endpoints, and how to interact with it.

---

## Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to the following base URL, which is created upon successful deployment with AWS SAM:

`https://{api_id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/Prod/`

Replace `{api_id}` and `{region}` with the values from your deployment output. For the most recent deployment, the base URL is:
**`https://9qgityvc65.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/`**

---

## Authentication

The API uses a custom header-based authentication mechanism. All requests to secure endpoints must include the following HTTP headers:

-   `x-user-id`: The unique identifier for the user making the request.
-   `x-organization-id`: The unique identifier for the organization the user belongs to.

These headers provide the necessary context for the AI to retrieve user-specific and company-specific information.

---

## Endpoints

The API exposes two primary endpoints.

### 1. Health Check

A simple endpoint to verify that the API is running and accessible.

-   **URL:** `/`
-   **Method:** `GET`
-   **Description:** Returns a simple success message indicating the service is operational.
-   **Headers:** None required.
-   **Success Response (200 OK):**
    -   **Content-Type:** `text/plain`
    -   **Body:** `AI Backend is running!`

### 2. AI Query Endpoint

This is the core endpoint of the application. It accepts a natural language query, converts it to a SQL query, executes it against the HR database, and returns a user-friendly response.

-   **URL:** `/ai-query`
-   **Method:** `POST`
-   **Description:** Processes a natural language prompt to perform actions or retrieve information from the HR database.
-   **Headers:**
    -   `Content-Type`: `application/json`
    -   `x-user-id`: `1` (Example)
    -   `x-organization-id`: `1` (Example)
-   **Request Body:**
    The request body must be a JSON object with a single key, `prompt`.
    ```json
    {
        "prompt": "Your natural language question here"
    }
    ```

#### AI Capabilities & Example Prompts

The AI can answer questions and perform updates related to the following HR domains based on the database schema:
-   **Personal Information:** "What is my role?", "Who is my manager?"
-   **Leave Management:** "What is my sick leave balance?", "How many leaves do I have left?"
-   **Company Policies:** "What is the work from home policy?"
-   **Payroll & Compensation:** "What is my base salary?", "How much is my PF deduction?"
-   **Data Updates:** "Update my location to 'New York'", "Set Rahul Verma's base salary to 60000"

#### Success Response (200 OK)

A successful response contains a confirmation message and the data retrieved or details of the update.

-   **For Data Retrieval (SELECT queries):**
    ```json
    {
        "success": true,
        "message": "Found the leave balance for Rahul Verma.",
        "data": [
            {
                "leave_balance": 15
            }
        ]
    }
    ```
-   **For Data Updates (UPDATE/INSERT queries):**
    ```json
    {
        "success": true,
        "message": "Rahul Verma's base salary has been updated to 60000.",
        "details": {
            "fieldCount": 0,
            "affectedRows": 1,
            "insertId": 0,
            "info": "Rows matched: 1  Changed: 1  Warnings: 0",
            "serverStatus": 2,
            "warningStatus": 0,
            "changedRows": 1
        }
    }
    ```

#### Error Responses

-   **Bad Request (400):** Missing headers or prompt.

        "error": "Missing prompt, x-user-id, or x-organization-id in request"
    }
    ```
-   **Multi-Action Error (400):** The AI detected a prompt asking for multiple distinct actions.
    ```json

    }
    ```

    }
    ```
